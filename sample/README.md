# Emarsys SDK Sample app

We created a sample app to demonstrate the basic functionality of our SDK, and to give an example how to integrate Emarsys in your application.

## Getting started with the released SDK

> __`Note`__
>  
>  These steps are working with the currently released version of the SDK. Please be aware that the master branch might not be compatible with it!


## Getting started with the current development state of the SDK

1. Clone the project from [here](https://github.com/emartech/android-emarsys-sdk)
2. Create a file named `localConfig.properties` in the root directory of the project and paste `useLocalDependencies=true` in it.
3. Run `./gradlew build` in the terminal in the root directory of the repository
